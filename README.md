A place for me to play with Kotlin and put my Kotlin code

# Running the Kotlin scripts
Kotlin is a compiled language. One way to run the scripts in this repo is to go [install the command-line compiler](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/command-line.html#create-and-run-an-application). Then, from the repo:

1. `kotlinc {kotlin_file_name.kt} -include-runtime -d {output_file_name.jar}`
2. `java -jar {output_file_name.jar}`
